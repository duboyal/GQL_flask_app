#### some notes
- new notes 

- ok we will need to set up the env variables so that this will work when deployed on an EC2 or something
- images for this should be in the last commit message essentially
---------------------------------------------------------------
#### posts are newest to oldest 

#### in init__ is where the database is but we will eventually make that a environment variable 

#### also think about .env file stuff 

#### otherwise typical docker compose down , build no cache, docker compose up 

### *** issue : in the data 

## OK 

#### right now its a little broken because url field needs to be migrated over, or database just wiped, which is what im expecting, so I will comment out the database commit code for now .

#### should do postgres  RDS eventually ? maybe?
 #### idk do i really need to store them ? i can look on the other project to see how we passs variables and display
