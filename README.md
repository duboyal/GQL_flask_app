#### in init__ is where the database is but we will eventually make that a environment variable 

#### also think about .env file stuff 

#### otherwise typical docker compose down , build no cache, docker compose up

#### should do postgres  RDS eventually ? maybe?
 #### idk do i really need to store them ? i can look on the other project to see how we passs variables and display
