#### some notes

#### posts are newest to oldest 

#### in init__ is where the database is but we will eventually make that a environment variable 

#### also think about .env file stuff 

#### otherwise typical docker compose down , build no cache, docker compose up 

### *** issue : in the data 

## OK 

#### right now its a little broken because url field needs to be migrated over, or database just wiped, which is what im expecting, so I will comment out the database commit code for now .

#### should do postgres  RDS eventually ? maybe?
