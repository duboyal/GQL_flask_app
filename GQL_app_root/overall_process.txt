1) get the structure going like the init.py, app.py, models.py
2) looks like wew do alal the data bases in app.py.


so you strat with schema (schema first)

then you go and make your query or resolver

then you add the things you need to add to app.py, just like imports and instantiations

query = ObjectType("Query")
mutation = ObjectType("Mutation")

query.set_field("listPosts", listPosts_resolver)
mutation.set_field("createPost", create_post_resolver)
